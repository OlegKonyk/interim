                This list includes courses, books (both digital and physical), and tools/utilities you can use to take your first step with the Python programming language. These resources are a combination of free and paid tutorials. Most of the paid lessons include a set of sample exercises you can use to get a taste of the quality of the content.

            <section>
                I would suggest using this book in tandem with a Code Academy or Code School class, so you can learn how all the Python “puzzle pieces” fit together to create solutions to actual problems.
