Instead of waiting for a bus or spending a small fortune on a taxi, a Lyft driver can pick you up at your location for a very reasonable fare."

Local drivers, usually with their own car, join Lyft after completing an application and vetting process. Whenever you need a ride, you can open the app to request a ride from your area. Then a nearby driver will accept the ride and come to you."
